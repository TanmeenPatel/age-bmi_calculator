# Age and BMI Calculator

This is a school project to make a Python program using the Tkinter and datetime library. The objective was to code an application to accept various details from the user and display the age in years and the BMI of the person. I am aware that this is an extremely simple program with little to no styling, but it is some progress that I would like to share with my friends and followers.

#How to Use:

To use this, all you need is a valid text editor (like Thonny or IDLE, VS Code if you have Python installed). Save the file and run the code and the application will open as a new window. Enter the details and click on any button.

# Future Intentions:

In the near future, I'm definitely going to redesign the whole application so it looks more presentable. Also, I might end up making this a full-fledged calculator with the ability to do much more, including arithmetic operations and unit conversions.
